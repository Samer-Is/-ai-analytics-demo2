## âœ… CHART DUPLICATION ISSUE SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED

### ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Solved:**
**User Issue**: "Charts are getting duplicated in each question"
- Previous behavior: Charts accumulated from all previous queries
- Example: Asking about loan defaults, then transaction volume would show BOTH sets of charts
- Confusion about which charts belonged to which analysis

### ðŸ”§ **Solution Implemented:**

#### **1. Automatic Chart Clearing**
- **Before each new analysis**: All previous charts are automatically removed
- **Location**: `LocalCodeExecutor._clear_previous_charts()`
- **Trigger**: Every time `execute_code()` is called
- **Result**: Clean slate for each new question

#### **2. UI Integration**
- **Domain Switching**: Charts cleared when switching between Banking/Hospital/Marketing
- **New Conversation**: Charts cleared when starting fresh conversation
- **Manual Control**: "ðŸ§¹ Clear Charts" button for user control
- **Smart Timing**: Only clears when appropriate, preserves during analysis

#### **3. Professional Demo Experience**
- **Focused Results**: Each question shows only its relevant charts
- **No Clutter**: Previous analysis artifacts don't interfere
- **Clean Presentation**: Professional appearance for demonstrations

### ðŸ“Š **Technical Implementation:**

```python
# Automatic clearing before each analysis
def execute_code(self, code: str):
    self._clear_previous_charts()  # Remove old charts
    # Execute new analysis code
    
# UI integration
def clear_output_charts():
    """Remove all PNG files from output directory"""
    for chart_file in Path("output").glob("*.png"):
        chart_file.unlink(missing_ok=True)
```

### âœ… **Testing Verified:**
- âœ… **Manual clearing**: Removes all charts on command
- âœ… **Automatic clearing**: Works before each new analysis  
- âœ… **Domain switching**: Clean start when changing domains
- âœ… **New conversations**: Fresh chart state for new sessions
- âœ… **Analysis execution**: Only shows charts from current query

### ðŸŽ¯ **Demo Benefits:**

**Before Fix:**
- Question 1: "Loan default rates" â†’ Shows 1 chart
- Question 2: "Transaction volume" â†’ Shows 2 charts (both old + new)
- Question 3: "Customer churn" â†’ Shows 3 charts (all previous + new)

**After Fix:**
- Question 1: "Loan default rates" â†’ Shows 1 relevant chart
- Question 2: "Transaction volume" â†’ Shows 1 relevant chart (old cleared)
- Question 3: "Customer churn" â†’ Shows 1 relevant chart (old cleared)

### ðŸš€ **Result:**
âœ… **Clean, Professional Interface**: Each analysis shows only its own charts  
âœ… **Improved User Experience**: No confusion about chart relevance  
âœ… **Demo-Ready**: Perfect for professional presentations  
âœ… **Automatic Management**: Works seamlessly without user intervention  

The AI Data Analytics Tool now provides a clean, focused visualization experience where each question displays only its relevant charts! ðŸŽ‰
