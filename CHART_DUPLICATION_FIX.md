## Activity Log Entry - August 7, 2025 (Chart Duplication Fix)

### Action: Resolved Chart Accumulation Issue

**User Problem**: Charts were getting duplicated in each question. When asking "Compare loan default rates across different age groups" and then "Which customers have the highest transaction volumes?", the user saw charts from both queries displayed together instead of just the relevant charts for the current question.

**Root Cause Analysis**: 
- Charts were being saved to the `output/` directory but never cleared between queries
- Each new analysis would create additional charts while retaining all previous ones
- The UI was displaying ALL charts in the output directory, not just those from the current analysis
- No cleanup mechanism existed for previous analysis artifacts

**Solution Implemented**:

1. **Automatic Chart Clearing in Backend**:
   - Added `_clear_previous_charts()` method to `LocalCodeExecutor` class
   - Automatically clears all PNG files from output directory before each new analysis
   - Implemented in `execute_code()` method to run before every code execution

2. **UI-Level Chart Management**:
   - Added `clear_output_charts()` function to `app.py`
   - Integrated clearing when switching domains
   - Added clearing when starting new conversations
   - Added manual "ðŸ§¹ Clear Charts" button for user control

3. **Smart Cleanup Strategy**:
   - Preserves charts during analysis execution
   - Only clears when starting new analysis or switching contexts
   - Prevents accidental data loss while ensuring clean slate for new queries

**Code Changes Made**:

```python
# Backend: LocalCodeExecutor.execute_code()
def execute_code(self, code: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    try:
        # Clear previous charts to avoid accumulation
        self._clear_previous_charts()
        # ... rest of execution

def _clear_previous_charts(self):
    """Clear previous chart files to prevent accumulation"""
    if self.output_dir.exists():
        for chart_file in self.output_dir.glob("*.png"):
            chart_file.unlink(missing_ok=True)

# Frontend: app.py
def clear_output_charts():
    """Clear all chart files from the output directory"""
    output_dir = Path("output")
    if output_dir.exists():
        for chart_file in output_dir.glob("*.png"):
            chart_file.unlink(missing_ok=True)

# UI Integration:
# - Domain switching: clear_output_charts() 
# - New conversation: clear_output_charts()
# - Manual button: "ðŸ§¹ Clear Charts"
```

**Testing Results**:
- âœ… Manual clearing removes all charts instantly
- âœ… Automatic clearing works before each new analysis
- âœ… Charts no longer accumulate between queries
- âœ… Each question shows only its relevant visualizations
- âœ… Domain switching starts with clean chart state
- âœ… New conversations begin with no previous charts

**User Benefits**:
- **Clean Interface**: Each analysis shows only relevant charts
- **No Confusion**: Previous query charts don't interfere with current results
- **Professional Presentation**: Demo flow shows focused, contextual visualizations
- **User Control**: Manual clear button for additional control
- **Automatic Management**: No user action required for normal operation

**Demo Impact**:
- Questions like "What is the customer churn rate?" will now show only churn-related charts
- Following up with "Show transaction volume by month" will display only transaction charts
- Professional demo experience with focused, relevant visualizations
- No chart clutter or confusion during presentations

### User Request Context
The user noticed that when asking multiple questions in sequence, charts from previous queries would continue to be displayed alongside new charts, creating visual clutter and confusion about which charts belonged to which analysis. This fix ensures each query shows only its own relevant visualizations.
