## Activity Log Entry - August 6, 2025

### Action: Fixed Critical Dataframes Loading Issue

**Problem Identified**: During demo testing, the system was generating error messages like "accounts table not found" because the generated analysis code was not including the dataframes loading code.

**Root Cause**: The `_execute_analysis_plan` method was only executing the LLM-generated analysis code without prepending the essential dataframes loading code.

**Solution Implemented**:

1. **Fixed newline escaping** in `_build_dataframes_loading_code()`:
   - Changed `\\n` to `\n` for proper code generation
   - This ensures the loading code has correct syntax

2. **Updated `_execute_analysis_plan()` method**:
   - Added automatic prepending of dataframes loading code before analysis code
   - Updated system prompt to inform LLM that dataframes are pre-loaded
   - Modified return structure to include both complete code and analysis-only code

3. **Enhanced system prompt**:
   - Explicitly lists the available DataFrame names for each domain
   - Clarifies that DataFrames are already loaded and available
   - Maintains the original MImic ReactCoderNode guidelines

**Code Changes Made**:
```python
# Before: Only analysis code was executed
execution_result = self.executor.execute_code(code)

# After: Complete code with dataframes loading + analysis
loader = DomainDataLoader(self.current_domain)
dataframes_code = loader.get_dataframes_loading_code()
complete_code = dataframes_code + "\n\n# Analysis Code:\n" + code
execution_result = self.executor.execute_code(complete_code)
```

**Expected Result**: All demo questions should now work properly as the required DataFrames (customers, accounts, transactions, loans for banking; patients, physicians, admissions, treatments for hospital; campaigns, leads, web_analytics, ad_spend for marketing) will be automatically loaded before the analysis code executes.

**Testing**: Running `test_churn_fix.py` to validate the banking churn analysis works correctly with the fix.

### Activity Log Entry - August 6, 2025 (Chart Improvements)

### Action: Implemented Chart Size and Data Visualization Improvements

**User Feedback**: Charts were too large in size and needed better data grouping (e.g., age brackets instead of individual ages, top 10 filtering for categorical data).

**Issues Addressed**:
1. **Chart Size**: Charts were 12x8 inches - too large for web display
2. **Data Saturation**: Age charts showed every individual age value
3. **Category Overflow**: Categorical charts showed all values instead of top N
4. **Missing Brackets**: No age grouping functionality

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Reduced Chart Dimensions**:
   - Changed default figure size from [12, 8] to [10, 6]
   - Reduced font size from 10 to 9
   - Lowered DPI from 150 to 100 for smaller file sizes

2. **Added Age Bracketing System**:
   - Created age bracket function: Under 18, 18-25, 26-35, 36-45, 46-55, 56-65, 65+
   - Integrated bracket code into system prompts
   - Provides more meaningful age distribution analysis

3. **Implemented Top N Filtering**:
   - Limited categorical data to top 10 items using `.value_counts().head(10)`
   - Prevents chart overcrowding with hundreds of categories
   - Focuses on most significant data points

4. **Enhanced Chart Formatting**:
   - Added mandatory `plt.xticks(rotation=45)` for better label readability
   - Implemented `plt.tight_layout()` to prevent label cutoff
   - Added `plt.close()` for memory management
   - Standardized chart template with proper titles and axis labels

**Code Changes Made**:

```python
# New chart configuration in dataframes loading code
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [10, 6]  # Reduced from [12, 8]
plt.rcParams['font.size'] = 9  # Reduced from 10
plt.rcParams['savefig.dpi'] = 100  # Reduced from 150

# Age bracketing function added to system prompts
def create_age_brackets(age_series):
    age_brackets = []
    for age in age_series:
        if age < 18: age_brackets.append("Under 18")
        elif age < 26: age_brackets.append("18-25")
        # ... (complete function)
    return age_brackets

# Chart template standardization
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
# plot code
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('output/chart.png', dpi=100, bbox_inches='tight')
plt.close()
```

**Testing Results**:
- Age distribution now shows 6 meaningful brackets instead of 50+ individual ages
- City distribution limited to top 10 cities for clarity
- Chart file sizes reduced significantly
- Better web display compatibility

**User Benefits**:
- ✅ Cleaner, more readable charts
- ✅ Meaningful data groupings (age brackets)
- ✅ Focused insights (top 10 filtering)
- ✅ Better web interface integration
- ✅ Faster loading times

## Activity Log Entry - August 21, 2025

### Action: Context Length Management Implementation Required

**Issue Identified**: User testing education domain question "What's the relationship between class size and student performance?" resulted in context length exceeded error:

```
Error generating report: Error code: 400 - {'error': {'message': "This model's maximum context length is 128000 tokens. However, your messages resulted in 224999 tokens. Please reduce the length of the messages.", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': 'messages', 'code': 'context_length_exceeded'}}
```

**Root Cause**: The conversation history has grown to 224,999 tokens (vs 128,000 limit), causing OpenAI API calls to fail.

**Solution Required**: Implement context management in backend.py to:
1. Track conversation token usage
2. Automatically truncate or summarize old messages when approaching limits
3. Maintain recent context while preserving domain-specific information
4. Enable continuous operation without context overflow

**Files Needing Updates**:
- backend.py: Add context length management methods
- app.py: Implement conversation truncation triggers

**Current Status**: System functional but needs context management for extended conversations.

**Next Actions**: 
1. ✅ Implement token counting and management in LLMWorkflow
2. ✅ Add conversation summarization capabilities  
3. ✅ Create automatic context truncation logic
4. ✅ Test education domain question after fix

**RESOLUTION SUCCESSFUL**: Context management fix implemented and validated. The education domain question "What's the relationship between class size and student performance?" now processes successfully without context length errors.

**Status**: System fully operational and ready for production use with all three domains (Banking, Hospital, Education) functional.
